In this package we'll create executable files which help proof scenario's


# Files
- k2
  - proof_optimal.py
    - This file is used to compute an instance where k=2 is not optimal for 4 jobs, thus then we can make sure that the greedy is not optimal for k=2.
  - hopping_jobs.py
    - this file is used to compute a sequence of jobs that creates an hopping behavior from initial jobs towards the optimal solution.
